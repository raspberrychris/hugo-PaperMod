**This post will give you some information if you are searching for a guide that will help you to spot toe nail fungus. If you are suffering from this affliction or if you think you are this will help you by telling you what to look for and helping you to work out how to get rid of this problem.**

We will walk you through the causes, we will also tell you how to spot this and of course we will let you know how to get rid of toenail fungus.

We will also suggest products, remedies and solutions throughout the course of this site so you can get the help that you need.

The first thing that we will look at is an overview and exactly what to look for to tell whether you have this condition.

## Overview:

**Nail fungus** is a common condition that can begin as a white or yellow spot under the tip of your fingernail or your toenail. When it starts it will be very difficult to spot but as the infection goes deeper you will find that your toenail could thicken and crumble at the edge, you can also find that this can spread to several nails.

If you have a mild condition, you may not need any treatment at all, however if this has progressed and it has ended up being painful and also caused thickened nails then you do need a certain amount of self-care and you can find medications that will help. The thing to remember with toenail fungus is that even if treatment is successful, you may find that this will always come back.

The medical name for nail fungus is [Onychomycosis]() and you may also know a closely related condition which is more common and that is athlete’s foot. The only difference between these conditions is one affects the nail, and one affects between the toes.

If you are trying to work out whether you have toenail fungus here are some of the symptoms to look for:

· Thickened

· Whitish to yellow-brown discoloration

· Brittle, crumbly or ragged

· Distorted in shape

· A dark color, caused by debris building up under your nail

· Smelling slightly foul

### Causes:

There are several causes and of course the main causes the fungi itself. You will find that the most common cause is a yeast type of fungus, and you can also find that certain moulds can cause nail infections as well.

You will find that this can happen in people of any age, but you will find that it is more common in older adults, this is because as you age the nails can become brittle and dry and the cracks in the nail can cause fungi to enter. You may also have health conditions that will make you more susceptible to nail problems and fungus. These can include diabetes, reduced blood circulation and even a weakened immune system can all contribute to having this problem.

You can even find that the toenail fungus can start from athlete’s foot, and it can spread from the foot onto the nail and then from one mail to another.

## The risk factors are as follows:

· Being older, owing to reduced blood flow, more years of exposure to fungi and slower growing nails

· Sweating heavily

· Having a history of athlete's foot

· Walking barefoot in damp communal areas, such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms

· Having a minor skin or nail injury or a skin condition, such as psoriasis

· Having diabetes, circulation problems or a weakened immune system

To fix toenail fungus you will normally find that your doctor will examine your nails, you may even find that they will take some clippings or scrape debris from under your nail to send to a lab or samples.

You will find that the treatment for toenail fungus can be difficult, most of the time a doctor will opt for self-care strategies and over-the-counter non-prescription medicines. This is if the condition is mild and is probably the easiest way to treat it. Bear in mind that treating toenail fungus can be a long journey and it can re-occur. The good news is that mild infections should be able to get fixed and under control without too much trouble.

The main thing to exercise here is patience, it can take a long time even months to be able to start seeing results.

If you have a more severe infection then you may get antifungal drugs, these will be prescribed, and you take them orally or can apply them directly to the nail.

## Some of the most common types are:

**Oral antifungal drugs**. These drugs are often the first choice because they clear the infection more quickly than do topical drugs. Options include terbinafine (Lamisil) and itraconazole (Sporanox). These drugs help a new nail grow free of infection, slowly replacing the infected part.

You typically take this type of drug for six to 12 weeks. But you won't see the end result of treatment until the nail grows back completely. It may take four months or longer to eliminate an infection. Treatment success rates with these drugs appear to be lower in adults over age 65.

Oral antifungal drugs may cause side effects ranging from skin rash to liver damage. You may need occasional blood tests to check on how you're doing with these types of drugs. Doctors may not recommend them for people with liver disease or congestive heart failure or those taking certain medications.

**Medicated nail polish**. Your doctor may prescribe an antifungal nail polish called ciclopirox (Penlac). You paint it on your infected nails and surrounding skin once a day. After seven days, you wipe the piled-on layers clean with alcohol and begin fresh applications. You may need to use this type of nail polish daily for almost a year.

**Medicated nail cream**. Your doctor may prescribe an antifungal cream, which you run into your infected nails after soaking. These creams may work better if you first thin the nails. This helps the medication get through the hard nail surface to the underlying fungus.

## **Surgery**

In some cases, surgery may be suggested and the temporary removal of the nail so that you can apply the antifungal drug directly onto the infection. This is only in extreme cases and should not be taken lightly. You will also find that some fungal nail infections do not respond to medications and if that is the case the doctor may suggest permanent nail removal if it is extremely painful.

## What to Do?

The good news is that even though toenail fungus can be problematic there is also ways that you can remedy this at home. Check out the site and several nail fungi remedies that we will be suggesting and check them out first especially if you only have a mild condition.

We hope this is helped you to spot toenail fungus and we also hope that you only have a mild case and can get this resolved fairly quickly.
